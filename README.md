# Awesome Free City!

Curated list of awesome links that is related to Free City movement. There are more new city projects in the world than free city projects, so this list is open to include software that is not directly targeted free cities, but also software that can be utilized by those free cities, even though the software might be curated for a larger audience.

Thanks to all [contributors](https://github.com/FreeCityPlatform/awesome-freecity/graphs/contributors), you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.
